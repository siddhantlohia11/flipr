This is a stock market app.
Let me walk you thrugh the entire application.

In index page i.e the home page, only the home and login/register button is working on the nav bar. Rest are just kept for future use.
Also, in the footer, only login and register buttons are active currently.

Next we land to login/ Register page. Here you are supposed to create an account by making an entry on all the columns compulsory (I haven't made it compulsory as it helps in reducing
the time for debugging) but please make sure to fill all the columns in order to register successfully. (It might take some time while loading the dashboard page so please bear with me)
Also note that when you input a invalid credential in the login page than it gives a msg "unauthorized", please go back and input the correct credentials. If you try to register with same email address than it won't take you forward and instead will load the same register pagae again. 

In the dashboard page, I have the NSE and BSE data with a link to graph and profile settings. From the dashboard if someone click the home button (i.e when he is loggged in) one can see a difference in the nav bar.
The chanage password option is not available (couldn't manage time). When someone click on graphs, it takes them to a page where he/she can see graphs of 5 comapanies as mentioned in the requirement list.
The graphs page might take a long time to load depending upon your internet speed. (Please wait for sometime)

It take some time to load the website for the first time only. 
Thank you for your time.
